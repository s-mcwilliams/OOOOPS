This is facilitated by delusional delusions of delusional grandeur and an impeccable sense of highly over estimated self worth and importance! I am also super cool, and <em>sooo</em> humble. Like, they should do studies on me and shit. That would make the world a much better place for everyone. That is my contribution, thank you, namaste, you're fucking welcome!</p>

                          This is a book I co-authored with myself covering all of the basic concepts within the subject of
                          why I am the most awesome person on the face of the planet and why everybody needs to realize that right now
                          and start living their lives for me for the sake and future of humanity. It's super cool and filled with like a ton of useful insights into why I'm so fucking awesome, you should check it out.
                          Available exclusively on Amazon for the low-low price of only $3,000,000,000, used - you can't afford a new one, get your copy today!!!

                      <em>
                          Yet another seminal work by me and yours truly. In this work I explore humanity's greatest crisis:
                          not being me. I offer a breath taking analysis of why this is and what I can do to fix it. Throughout the book
                          I offer many solutions to this problem, but the final solution is guaranteed to leave you gasping for air.
                          With meager contributions from the esteemed Rev. Alzo Mey, I delve super deep into the human condition and
                          explore what sets me apart from other humans, namely, my unique brand of awesome, golden wisdom and super cool attributes
                          which make me truly amazing and so much better than everyone else. This book is available on kindle and in paperback,
                          but you cannot find it anywhere because they are all sold out and nobody will ever part with their copy of
                          this humbly divine masterpiece and testament to the triumph of my will. So there you have it, you're not me,
                          go choke on your own tears.
